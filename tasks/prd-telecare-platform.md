# Product Requirements Document: Telecare Platform for Gaza

## Introduction/Overview

The Telecare Platform is a mobile-first web application designed to bridge the healthcare expertise gap by connecting verified UK GMC-registered doctors with clinicians in Gaza (initially) and other Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in the future. The platform enables remote medical consultations, knowledge sharing, and capacity building through a secure, low-bandwidth optimized system specifically designed for resource-limited settings.

The primary problem this solves is the lack of access to specialist medical expertise in Gaza and other underserved regions, where local healthcare providers often face complex cases without adequate specialist support. By creating a direct connection to verified UK specialists who volunteer their time, we can improve patient outcomes and build local medical capacity.

## Goals

1. **Establish a verified network** of UK GMC-registered doctors willing to provide remote consultations
2. **Enable secure communication** between UK specialists and Gaza-based clinicians with English-Arabic translation
3. **Provide three consultation modes**: asynchronous forum discussions, scheduled meetings, and emergency consultations
4. **Optimize for low-bandwidth environments** ensuring accessibility even with limited internet connectivity
5. **Build local capacity** through knowledge transfer and mentorship
6. **Ensure patient privacy** through pseudonymization while maintaining case continuity
