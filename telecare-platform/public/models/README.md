This folder should contain the face-api.js models for face detection and recognition.

To use face detection in production, download the following models from:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Required models:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_tiny_model-weights_manifest.json  
- face_landmark_68_tiny_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-shard2
- face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json

For the demo, face verification is simulated and these models are optional.
